    "Advantages of Multithreading:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency:- Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently within a single process. This can lead to better resource utilization, as threads can perform tasks concurrently, especially when some threads are blocked, such as waiting for I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness:- In applications with user interfaces (UIs), multithreading can enhance responsiveness. For example, the main thread can handle user input and interface updates, while secondary threads perform background tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Performance:- For certain types of tasks, multithreading can improve performance by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores. This is particularly beneficial for CPU-bound tasks that can be parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing:- Threads within the same process share memory space, making it easy to share data and resources among threads without the need for complex inter-process communication (IPC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity and Debugging:- Multithreaded code can be challenging to write and debug. Race conditions, deadlocks, and other synchronization issues can be hard to identify and resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:- Race conditions occur when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior. Proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks) are required to prevent race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks:- Deadlocks can occur when two or more threads are stuck in a state where they are waiting for each other to release resources. Detecting and resolving deadlocks can be complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIL Limitation (Python):- In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallel execution of threads. This means that multithreading may not fully utilize multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks.\n",

In other words, it's a circular waiting condition where processes or threads are stuck, and no progress can be made. There are typically four conditions that must be met for a deadlock to occur:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Exclusion:- At least one resource must be non-shareable, meaning only one process/thread can use it at a time.\n",
